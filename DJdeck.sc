/* 
TODO
- test
    - interface functionality
    - beat sync accuracy
- review sound quality
- why can't I beatjump when paused?
- keep syncing enabled when new track is loaded
- allow unquantized beetjumping by default, and enable quantization via general quantization support for incoming midi/hid
    - how to support different clocks? No need, we just put everything on the master clock, this is okay because the entire idea behind quantized/delayed beatjumpig, is to keep everything lined up with ease


NICE TO HAVE
- get rid of popping when beatjumping
- reduce loading time of songs, make a function to preview songs which uses VDiskIn, which requires less buffer to be loaded as compared to ReadBuf
- more elaborate tempo functionality, see my thought in the MidiHidSystem-Guide.schelp
- BufRd has only single precision, so after 6.3min it becomes messy; I do like listening to long tracks... -> solution can be to overwrite the first part of the buffer when we start approaching the 6.3 min

DONE
- use shift-sync to enable sync, and copy tempo from slave to master
- tracks should not loop
- build synthdef which has DJ filter, using deadduck VST
- finish midi mapping
     - midi feedback
- looping functionality
- needledropping functionality (scrolling through track)
- try to do all time sensitive shit with setSynchronous
- pitchbend functionality
    - note userInducedOffset;
    - write pitchBendFunction which can be mapped similar as tracktor 
        - perhaps the dualTarget can be used for this, instead of assigning to button on off, assign to encoder forward backward -> for buttons I support providing two targets
        - create encoder sensitivity and acceleration settings (which can also be used for pitchbending; idea allow for the functions to respond to an argument and instead of making this always one let this depend on sensitivity and acceleration) -> Should distinguish between button, continous, encoderButton, and enconderContiunous
        -> added a new mode to the MidiCC object which does what we want, icm with a continuous target (not tested)
    - test whether buffer playback is synced
- keeping track of current play position:
    - append the track with a third channel which contains a ramp (not that easy to accomplisch as buffers can't be merged)
    - similar as above but use a standard ramp buffer, and read it in parallel (analyze whether these buffers are always synced)
    - use sendID of VDiskIn
- load track in sync
- tempo/phase syncing (see TrackClock)
    - make clock.beats leading by means of dependency
- .loadDouble; 
    - not working yet: it works when loading it directly as first track; it does not work if we have first loaded another track, synth.isRunning remains false, also when sending synth.run(true); no isRunning is not the problem (this was due to me not having launched a NodeWatcher)
    - main issue was due to bufnum changing when pointing buffer to the buffer of the other deck
- make reference buffer loading more efficient
    - referenceBuffer for each deck
        - should not get copied during loadDouble
        - is loaded in .init
        - in elongated when necessary using .loadCollection;
    - should write the buffer back and test whether this goed correctly, the appending
    - maybe simpler to have one referenceBuffer and see whether we can read this (at multiple decks) while appending it (or make it sufficiently long right from the start, check what the longest track is in our collection (should not be longer than an hour, make a buffer of an hour))
    -> quite a big change made, I switched to using BufRd
- before resetiting the deck, should we pause the synth? as to make sure we get not buffer issues/warnings
- save userinduced gridoffset with the track
    -> I also made sure that this is Archived, and loaded back in when we load the library
- synth and synthDef integration into project files
    - I added the synthDef to the class, such that we keep all related stuff in one document

NOT NEEDED
- I need to make sure we take into account the latency induced by the EnconderKernel when beatjumping/syncing phase between the decks clock and playback
    - the difficulty arises because we want to schedule beat jumps based on beats, however this latency if beat independent. There is no way to schedule an event x seconds prior to beat y
    - so you then need to reschedule the event if the tempo changes; this is a feature supercollider does not have; we could perhaps make some proxy object which we mute, and schedule another instance at the beat we want
    - but maybe it is more need to have a jumpAtFrame variable in the synthdef, if the current position becomes bigger, we have a positive edge, this we use to reset the sweep; this jumpAtFrame wil be constantly recalculated, taking into account also the latency; which it does not need to take into account.. because the frame we want to jump at remains unchanged, we want to arrive earlier at this frame; which is not hard to achieve with this route; 
        - use InRange.kr(in: in, lo: 1.0, hi: 1000.0) to determine when to beat jump
        -a drawback is though that we lose our hardSync approach, currently we can have drift in between beatJumps; but a beatJump glues the trackPlayback and the tempoClock
            - we can use the existing jumpToPosition to sync it
    - OR!! we just accept that the track is always running late by a set amount with respect to the clock; and we match this latency with the server communication induced latency for patterns; because this latency will always accur hence we do need some way of taking it into account [this corresponds with the manner that LinkClock talkes about latency and patterns]
        - benefit of BufRd is more and easier control over playback position
        - drawback of using PlayBuf is that we need a playAlong buffer in order to keep track of position; but maybe we can read this buffer from disk instead of from collection
        - with playbuf it is harder to maintain always x samples ahead (to compensate from kernelEncoder)
